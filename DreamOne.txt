1-Gain experience first

you may ask why should i do this first for my start up?
Someone are intrested in working at companies like amazon,microsoft,tweeter,and so on
But There are someone who want to work for themselves and leave their previous job

In my view if You who are gonna be a successful developer  
you should gain experience first because if you are gonna found a start up you must have enough experience in your field
otherwise you wlii fail at first moment and i advise you to work at a good and successful company and gain experience
and then found your own start up and business you are intrested in

This was a short advice from me and i hope you to enjoy it 

Good luck my friends
